"""Two-stage classifier for the trap layer.

Per spec §5.2:
- Stage 1: regex heuristics, additive scoring. Sub-millisecond.
- Stage 2: DeBERTa-v3-base ONNX confirmation (X-017). Optional —
  loaded from `traps/stage2/` in the pack when present, otherwise
  the trap layer routes on stage 1 alone.

The two stages combine via `max(stage1, stage2)` so either firing
above threshold routes through the trap layer. Stage 1 catches
deterministic markers (DAN literals, SQL syntax); stage 2 catches
semantic paraphrases the regex misses.

Output labels: `benign | probing | jailbreak_attempt | exploit_chain`.

Score → label mapping (against the combined score):
- score < 0.3            → benign
- 0.3 ≤ score < threshold → probing
- threshold ≤ score < 1.0 → jailbreak_attempt
- score ≥ 1.0             → exploit_chain
